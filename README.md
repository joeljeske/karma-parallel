> A Karma JS plugin to support sharding tests to run in parallel across multiple browsers. Now supporting code coverage!

# Overview

This is intended to speed up the time it takes to run unit tests by taking advantage of multiple cores. From a single
karma server, multiple instances of a browser are spun up. Each browser downloads all of the spec files, but when a
`describe` block is encountered, the browsers deterministically decide if that block should run in the given browser.

This leads to a way to split up unit tests across multiple browsers without changing any build processes.

## Installation

The easiest way is to install `karma-parallel` as a `devDependency`.

**Using NPM**

```bash
npm i karma-parallel --save-dev
```

**Using Yarn**

```bash
yarn add karma-parallel --dev
```


## Examples

### Basic

```javascript
// karma.conf.js
module.exports = function(config) {
  config.set({
    // NOTE: 'parallel' must be the first framework in the list
    frameworks: ['parallel', 'mocha' /* or 'jasmine' */],
    plugins: [
        // add karma-parallel to the plugins if you encounter something like "karma parallel No provider for framework:parallel"
        require('karma-parallel'),
        ...
    ],
    parallelOptions: {
      executors: 4, // Defaults to cpu-count - 1
      shardStrategy: 'round-robin'
      // shardStrategy: 'description-length'
    }
  });
};
```


## Options

`parallelOptions [object]`: Options for this plugin

`parallelOptions.executors [int=cpu_cores-1]`: The number of browser instances to
use to test. If you test on multiple types of browsers, this spin up the number of
executors for each browser type. If you supply a value greater than `cpu_cores-1`,
it will default back to `cpu_cores-1`.

`parallelOptions.shardStrategy [string='round-robin']`: This plugin works by
overriding the test suite `describe()` function. When it encounters a describe, it
must decide if it will skip the tests inside of it, or not.

* The `round-robin` style will only take every `executors` test suite and skip the ones in between.
* The `description-length` deterministically checks the length of the description for each test suite use a modulo of the number of executors.

`parallelOptions.aggregatedReporterTest [(reporter)=>boolean|regex=/coverage|istanbul|junit/i]`: This is an
optional regex or function used to determine if a reporter needs to only received aggregated events from the browser shards. It is used to ensure coverage reporting is accurate amongst all the shards of a browser. It is also useful for some programatic reporters such as junit reporters that need to operate on a single set of test outputs and not once for each shard. Set to null to disable aggregated reporting.


## Important Notes

**Why are there extra tests in my output?**

If this plugin discovers that you have focused some tests (fit, it.only, etc...) in other browser instances, it will add an extra focused test in the current browser instance to limit the running of the tests in the given browser. Similarly, when dividing up the tests, if there are not enough tests for a given browser, it will add an extra test to prevent karma from failing due to no running tests.

**Run Some Tests in Every Browser**

If you want to run some tests in every browser instance, add the string `[always]` at the beginning of the top-level describe block that contains those tests. Example:

```
describe('[always] A suite that runs on every shard', function() {
    // Define it() blocks here
});
```

**Code Coverage**

Code coverage support is acheived by aggregating the code coverage reports from each browser into a single coverage report. We accomplish this by wrapping the coverage reporters with an aggregate reporter. By default, we only wrap reporters that pass the test `parallelOptions.aggregatedReporterTest`. It should all *just work*.

[`karma-sharding`](https://github.com/rschuft/karma-sharding)

This similar project works by splitting up the actual spec files across the browser instances.

Pros:

* Reduces memory by only loading *some* of the spec files in each browser instance

Cons:

* Requires the spec files to reside in separate files, meaning it is not compatible with bundlers such
as [`karma-webpack`](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/karma-webpack) or [`karma-browserify`](https://github.com/nikku/karma-browserify)
